# Project: Inter-Exchange Arbitrage Bot

## 1. Objective
Develop a high-performance, low-latency cryptocurrency arbitrage bot that discovers and capitalizes on price discrepancies of contracts between various digital asset exchanges.

## 2. Core Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Exchange Interaction Library:** CCXT
- **Virtual Environment Management:** uv

## 3. Key Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Exchange Connectivity & Data Fetching
- **Multi-Exchange Support:** Connect to a configurable list of cryptocurrency exchanges using the `ccxt` library's unified API.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilize Python's `asyncio` and `ccxt.pro` to fetch real-time market data (order books, tickers) asynchronously, ensuring low-latency data streams.
- **API Key Management:** Securely load and manage API credentials for multiple exchanges from a configuration file or environment variables.

### 3.2. Arbitrage Logic
- **Opportunity Identification:** Implement a core engine that continuously scans for price differences between the same trading pairs on different exchanges.
- **Fee & Slippage Calculation:** The arbitrage logic must accurately account for trading fees, withdrawal fees, and potential slippage to calculate net profitability.
- **High-Speed Comparison:** The algorithm must be optimized for speed to identify opportunities in near real-time.

### 3.3. Trade Execution
- **Automated Order Placement:** Execute simultaneous buy and sell orders on the respective exchanges once a profitable arbitrage opportunity is confirmed.
- **Order Management:** Track the status of placed orders (e.g., `open`, `filled`, `cancelled`) and handle partial fills.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for failed API calls, order execution failures, and network issues.

### 3.4. Risk Management & Configuration
- **Centralized Configuration:** Manage all settings (exchanges, trading pairs, API keys, risk parameters) from a single, easy-to-use configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`).
- **Risk Parameters:** Include configurable parameters such as maximum trade size, minimum profitability threshold, and maximum acceptable slippage.
- **Emergency Stop:** Implement a "kill switch" mechanism to immediately halt all trading activity.

### 3.5. Environment & Deployment
- **`uv` Integration:** The project must be set up to use `uv` for creating the virtual environment and managing Python dependencies.
- **Setup Scripts:** Provide clear scripts and documentation for setting up the virtual environment and installing dependencies using `uv`.
- **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to record all activities, including data fetching, identified opportunities, executed trades, profits/losses, and errors.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** All components must be designed for maximum performance and minimum latency. Asynchronous programming is mandatory for all I/O-bound operations.
- **Reliability:** The bot must be able to run continuously with high availability and recover gracefully from temporary network or exchange API issues.
- **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for easily adding new exchanges or modifying arbitrage strategies in the future.
